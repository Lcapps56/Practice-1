# Practice-1

GOAL
The goal of this "Phase" is to practice my fundementals as i get back into coding. 
The skills utilized in these projects are...
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Mobile responsiveness
- flexbox
- consistent and organized coding practices
- github (obviously)

Project details and desc...
- 3 projects were code alongs from youtube (Starbucks, PS4, timer)
- 2 projects where i simply looked at a design and coded it. (real estate, landing page)
- 1 project for sake of practicing flexbox (flexbox practice)

Reflection
Getting back into coding has been great. Im a little rusty but it did not take long to gain momentum and familiarity.
The most challenging of this set of projects was the "Real estate" site. I looked at a design and coded it myself. The form was the hardest part

Next
I plan on moving into SASS, deeper into JavaScript, template making maybe creating a curriculum, potentially API's
